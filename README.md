# Portfolio-HW-2

Remaking Portfolio

This project was built to showcase my new skills as a web developer. The project is an "about me" page in which a short bio about myself can be found, along with a contact information page as well as a porfolio page. I figured this project would be a bit more comfortable for me considering we could use bootstrap to help us. However, I still spent a lot of time on this trying to work through different issues that arouse. I spent the most time trying to place a footer that would be responsive to my changing layout once the viewport was changed. All in all I'm happy with it and was excited to add some stylistic changes to it to make it more "me".
